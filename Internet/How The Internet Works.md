### Switches: A device used when we want computers in the same environment(an office, at home, etc.) to communicate with each other. Cables are used to connect computers to the switch. Normally CAT-5 and CAT-6 cables are used. (CAT-6 are faster than CAT-5. CAT=> Category). Switches cannot use wireless technology. The higher the number of ports(LAN Ports) on a switch, the more expensive it is.


### Local Area Network (LAN): A computer network that connects computers within a restricted area (residence, school, university campus,office, etc.). Switches are used to create LANs.

### Packets: Messages sent from one machine to another. One machine sends a packet, it goes through the switch, where the destination of the packet is read,and sent to the port of the computer its supposed to go to. The packet is then sent to the location(another machine in the same environment). 

### Router: A Device that enables computers to access the internet. The switch is first connected to the router, and then the router is connected to the internet using a cable provided by our Internet Service Provider(ISP)

### Internet Connections Using Switches and Routers: A packet is sent from a PC to the switch, The switch reads the packet destination(the internet), and sends it to the router. The router then sends the packet to the internet.


### Access Points: Used to connect computers in the same environment, using wireless technology.
